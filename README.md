Recipe App built with React.

For this app I used Edamam API.

You can search for a recipe using two filters: main ingredient/food and diet.

Every recipe contains details like number of calories, ingredients, health labels, etc.

You can add any recipe to Favorites. You can also remove it anytime you like.

Please note that you are allowed to make maximum 5 requests per minute, as I am using the developer plan of the API. If you try to make more than 5 requests per minute, you have to wait 1 minute before trying again.
